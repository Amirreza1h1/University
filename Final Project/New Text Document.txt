Making the Simulation More Dynamic
Here are some ideas to make the simulation more interactive and reflective of evolutionary dynamics:

Adaptive Strategies: Allow players to change their strategy based on outcomes, such as a "LearningBot" that adapts based on past rounds.
Decay in Scores: Introduce a slight decay in scores each round, representing survival costs, which could pressure bots to engage in more cooperative behavior.
Random Events: Add random environmental factors or events that could impact scores or enforce crashes, such as an occasional “disaster” round that penalizes all players.
Hybrid Strategies: Create bots that can switch between cooperative and defiant moves based on environmental factors, population density, or current round results.
Scoring Metrics and Graphs: Track average and median scores each round, and visualize these alongside crashes and winner sums to observe score distributions.
These changes would deepen the dynamics of the game, revealing how different strategies might evolve in response to shifting conditions.
