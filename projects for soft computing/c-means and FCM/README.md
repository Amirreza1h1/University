# FCM and c-means

<p><b>This file is for educational purpose</b></p>
<p><i>Whole data is generated.</i></p>

### data_1

<p>It has less shared data between clusters and we guess the behavior between two algorithms be the same!</p>
<p>as we see below.</p>

### data_2

<p>Here our data is over shared so we expect that the conclusion of two algorithms are not the same!</p>
<p>as we see below.</p>

## Logic

<p>At first, we should find the best number of cluster in our data so as you can see in both pictures in data_2 our FCM algorithm detected two main clusters, but c-means find three!</p>
<p>also for FCM, we decided to show the membership function that our classmates can realize the difference between FCM and c-means better.</p>
<p>Finally, I think its a good example for educational goals to differ the behavior of how two algorithms function.</p>
