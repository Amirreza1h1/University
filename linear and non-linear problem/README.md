# Linear and non-linear problem

---

<p>What's the difference!</p>

<p>Here, our problem has 2 feature and 3 different classes(labels).</p>
<p>here we show the scatter plot for knowing better</p>
<p>Here we have a exel file(.xlsx) which has created data(artifitial data)</p>

### scatter plot.py

<p>in this code, we try to draw the scatter plot from the .xlsx file</p>

## Linear

<p>As scatter plot shows we can divide our classes with a line (one line) which they don't have any common between them</p>

## Non-linear

<p>here scatter plot illustrates that each class has vary data which can not be divide by one line so we called them non-linear problems!</p>
